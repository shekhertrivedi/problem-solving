There are two ways to execute the program:

1. Put the input into the file_input.txt

Execution:

Go to the src folder (where makefile resides: /parking-lot/src$)

Give the below command:

    make runService

It gives below output on console:

    Initializing Command processor...

    Initialized

    Please enter commands to be executed

      file => To execute the commands from file_input.txt

      commands list from sample file => To perform different operations

      exit => To exit the console


Give command

    file -----------------[press enter]

It will execute the commands from the file line by line.


2. Execute the individual commands



Recognized Commands: [Can be referred from sample_commands.txt]

create_parking_lot 6
park KA-01-HH-1234 White
leave 4
status
registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White
slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White
slot_number_for_registration_number KA-01-HH-3141


Above commands can be executed as an individual entity.

For e.g. 

create_parking_lot 6


The relevant output can be referred on console only. Moreover the status command will print the list of parking slots with necessary information.


Extension:
*********

The implementation can be expanded further to create makefile and prepare recipes to test, extract the coverage and deduce the executables through go build.

REST wrapper service can be implemented which can expose the endpoints to execute the commands. State can be maintained using the DB and shared with multiple successive requests.

The current implementation has the provision to expand the solution to multiple vehicles. It is capable of managing multiple parking lots.
